EECS481_PongGame
================

Simple, rough project designed to demonstrate that the SDK was successfully installed/played with. 

The game is a simple version of pong, which increments each player’s score whenever the ball bounces off the side wall rather than the player’s ‘blocker’. Player one uses the A key to move the left piece up, and the Z key to move it down. Player two does the same thing with the K and M keys.

The code should be run using Visual Studio 2010 with XNA version 4. In order to access the repository,
